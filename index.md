## ECE M202A Embedded Systems @ UCLA (Fall 2021)

Welcome to the website for Fall 2021 offering of UCLA's ECE M202A (aka CS M213A) course on embedded systems. 

### What is this course about?

This course covers concepts relating the design of IoT (Internet of Things) and Human-Cyber-Physical systems. In these systems acomputing, networking, sensing, and actuation capabilities are deeply embedded in physical objects, allowing them to intelligently interact with humans and environment in via sensors and actuators. The design of these systems faces challenges all across the hardware-spftware stack, such as real-time requirements, energy-constraints, resource limitations, coordination across the edge and the cloud, etc.

### Catalog Description

Designed for graduate computer science and electrical and computer engineering students. Methodologies and technologies for the design of embedded systems. Topics include hardware and software platforms for embedded systems, techniques for modeling and specification of system behavior, software organization, real-time operating system scheduling, real-time communication, and packet scheduling, low-power battery and energy-aware system design, timing synchronization, fault tolerance and debugging, and techniques for hardware and software architecture optimization. Theoretical foundations as well as practical design methods.
